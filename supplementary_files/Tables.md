Using a time-inhomogeneous generalized linear model (GLM) diffusion approach simulated fluxes by GLEAM were tested as a predictors, the results of which are summarised in Supplementary Table S3-S6. These tables list the estimated inclusion probabilities, comparing fluxes based on the standard air-passenger network (air) with Markovian (M) and and recurrent travel (Supplementary Table S3), with seasonally (S) aggregated fluxes over time against annually (A) aggregated fluxes (Supplementary Table S4), as well as with peak time represented by January (Jan) against December (Dec) (Supplementary Table S5) and November (Nov) against December (Dec) (Supplementary Table S6). These analysis span the full H3N2 (H3), H1N1(H1), Yamagata(YAM) and Victoria (VIC) data sets, incorporating or excluding the sample size residuals (r or nr, respectively).
